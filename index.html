            Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute,
            just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.
        </div>
        <div class="div-2">
            In West Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out,
            maxin', relaxin', all cool and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were
            up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said,
            "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air".
        </div>
        <div class="div-3">
            I whistled for a cab, and when it cam near, the license plate said FRESH and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought nah forget it, Yo home to Bel Air.
            I pulled up to the house about seven or eight nd I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later". I
            looked at my kingdom, I was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.
